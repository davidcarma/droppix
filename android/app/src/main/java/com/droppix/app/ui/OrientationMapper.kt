 * Buckets the device's physical orientation (the angle from Android's

 * code only when the device has *settled* into a new orientation.
 *
 * Anti-jitter is two-fold:
 *  - a spatial dead-zone around the 45° quarter boundaries (so holding near a
 *    boundary doesn't flip-flop), and
 *  - a settle time (the new quarter must be held for [settleMs] before emitting).
 *
 * Pure logic (no Android imports) so it can be unit-tested with synthetic angle /
