# droppix — feature & docs status

**Last verified:** 2026-07-18 on branch `feat/web-pwa-client` (web unit tests; host C++ needs Linux build).

Living source of truth for "is this designed / planned / shipped?". Design specs under `superpowers/specs/` keep their historical detail; this file overrides stale **Status** lines until those headers catch up.

## Product maturity

| Host GUI (Qt6 multi-session control panel) | **Shipped** |
| Android client (minSdk 21) | **Shipped** |
| Linux desktop receive client (`client/`) | **Shipped** |
| Packaging (AppImage + Flatpak host/client, APK script) | **Shipped** |
| macOS host backend | **Archived** (`macos/`; not in build). CGVirtualDisplay OSS research: `2026-07-18-cgvirtualdisplay-oss-research.md` |
| Cross-desktop beyond KWin | **Partial** — M1 seam + X11 backend shipped; Sway/GNOME Wayland still open |
| Web PWA client (host-served) | **Partial** — implemented on `feat/web-pwa-client`; needs Chromium LAN E2E before Shipped |

## How to keep this current

When a feature lands on `master`:

1. Update the matching row here to **Shipped** (or **Partial** with what remains).
2. Set the design spec header to `**Status:** Shipped (YYYY-MM-DD).`
3. Leave the historical plan as-is (plans are build journals; do not rewrite mid-flight checklists after the fact unless fixing factual errors).
